<!--

inline Elements:- 
Flow: Inline elements are positioned within the flow of text or other inline elements. 
They do not start on a new line and instead flow alongside other elements.

Dimensions: These elements do not honor the width and height properties. 
They only occupy as much space as their content requires.

Margins and Padding: Inline elements handle horizontal margins and padding but may not properly handle vertical margins and padding.
Usage: Typically used for small pieces of content or text within a block-level container. Common examples include links and spans.


block Elements:- 
Flow: Block elements start on a new line and take up the full width of their parent container by default.
They push subsequent elements to the next line.

Dimensions: These elements fully respect the width and height properties. 
They can be sized and will expand to the width of their container unless otherwise specified.
Margins and Padding: Block elements handle all margins and padding, including vertical margins and padding, 
which affect the layout and spacing around the element.

Usage: Typically used for creating sections of content or larger structural elements on a page. Examples include paragraphs, headers, and divs.



inline-block Elements:- 
Flow: Inline-block elements behave like inline elements in that they do not start on a new line.
 However, they can be sized with width and height properties.

Dimensions: These elements respect the width and height properties, allowing them to have defined dimensions.
Margins and Padding: Inline-block elements handle both horizontal and vertical margins and padding.

Usage: Useful when you want elements to appear next to each other horizontally but also need to define their size.
 This can be helpful for layout and design where both alignment and sizing are necessary.
